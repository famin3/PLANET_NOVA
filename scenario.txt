***PREVIOUS VERSIONS***

PROTOTYPE SCENARIO

Part 1 ( Normal working lights, working gravity accelerator)

	Game start when player stands in front of the window looking at the planet
and speaks to himself (Text_1). Music from the radio plays in the background. Speech
indicates with words and head movements to go to the desk and watch the notes on it -
newspaper article about little girl that died on the street in front of her home hit by
a car. Pick up the newspaper(Text_2), read the header. When player stops reading the newspaper,
character voice says(Text_3) that he needs come back to his duties. Info on screen -> 'Go to office
room'. When close to the door lights go off, gravity stops working correctly ( random
impulses to throw player few times and black out the screen). When character wakes up,
lights are off, gravity is still on.

Part 2
	Player wakes up with lights off, the only light is coming from the planet. Player
needs to reach the storage to get his suit on ( without it impulse he can apply is really
small). Suit has some thrusters to help with moving in no gravity. Next step is to reach
the computer in next room to turn on emergency lights - these, when turned off, are not
working properly, just flickering all the time. When player gets a suit, he can use a
flashlight, but the battery is drained very fast and it takes long time to recharge. While
going there he starts hearing voices. When light is turned on voice tells him to go to her.
On the way, all big objects start moving and start flying towards character, lights turns off
and objects are back in place. Bit further hears singing behind him, when player turns around
singing stops but now behind him appears shadow of a girl. When reaching the room, after short
time alert goes on, warning about destabilized (something). When close to the exit something
blows up behind and ... THE END
